                                Warm sauces are of two kinds: the leading
                                sauces, also called “mother sauces,” and the
                                small sauces, which are usually derived from the
                                first-named, and are generally only modified
                                forms thereof. Cooking stock only includes the
                                leading sauces, but I shall refer to the small
                                hot sauces and the cold sauces at the end of the
                                auxiliary stock.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Experience, which plays such an important part
                                in culinary work, is nowhere so necessary as in
                                the preparation of sauces, for not only must the
                                latter flatter the palate, but they must also
                                vary in savour, consistence and viscosity, in
                                accordance with the dishes they accompany. By
                                this means, in a well-ordered dinner, each dish
                                differs from the preceding ones and from those
                                that follow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, sauces must, through the perfection
                                of their preparation, obey the general laws of a
                                rational hygiene, wherefore they should be
                                served and combined in such wise as to allow of
                                easy digestion by the frequently disordered
                                stomachs of their consumers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Carême was quite justified in pluming himself
                                upon the fact that during his stay at the
                                English Court his master—the Prince Regent—had
                                assured him that he (Carême) was the only one
                                among those who had served his Highness whose
                                cooking had been at all easy of digestion.
                                Carême had grasped the essential truth that the
                                richer the cooking is, the more speedily do the
                                stomach and palate tire of it. And, indeed, it
                                is a great mistake to suppose that, in order to
                                do good cooking, it is necessary to be prodigal
                                in one’s use of all things. In reality, practice
                                dictates fixed and regular quantities, and from
                                these one cannot diverge without upsetting the
                                hygienic and sapid equilibrium on which the
                                value of a sauce depends. The requisite
                                quantities of each ingredient must, of course,
                                be used, but neither more nor less, as there are
                                objections to either extreme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Any sauce whatsoever should be smooth, light
                                (without being liquid), glossy to the eye, and
                                decided in taste. When these conditions are
                                fulfilled it is always easy to digest even for
                                tired stomachs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An essential point in the making of sauces is
                                the seasoning, and it would be impossible for me
                                to lay sufficient stress on the importance of
                                not indulging in any excess in this respect. It
                                too often happens that the insipidness of a
                                badly-made sauce is corrected by excessive
                                seasoning; this is an absolutely deplorable
                                practice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Seasoning should be so calculated as to be
                                merely a complementary factor, which, though it
                                must throw the savour of dishes into relief, may
                                not form a recognisable part of them. If it be
                                excessive, it modifies and even destroys the
                                taste peculiar to every dish—to the great
                                detriment of the latter and of the consumer’s
                                health.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is therefore desirable that each sauce should
                                possess its own special flavour, well defined,
                                the result of the combined flavours of all its
                                ingredients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If, in the making of sauces, one allowed oneself
                                to be guided by those principles which are the
                                very foundation of good cookery, the general
                                denunciation of sauces by the medical faculty
                                would be averted; and this denunciation no sauce
                                deserves if it be carefully prepared,
                                conformably with the laws prescribed by practice
                                and its resulting experience.

                                        for veloutés, or cream sauces; and white
                                        roux, for white sauces and Béchamel.

                                            is limited to a few minutes, as it

                                            the need of Lenten Espagnole. The
                                            ordinary Espagnole being really a
                                            neutral sauce in flavour, it is
                                            quite simple to give it the
                                            necessary flavour by the addition of
                                            the required quantity of fish fumet.
                                            It is only, therefore, when one
                                            wishes to conform with the demands
                                            of a genuine Lent sauce that a fish
                                            Espagnole is needed.

                                                    from that of the ordinary
                                                    kind, except that the bacon
                                                    is replaced by mushroom
                                                    parings in the Mirepoix, and

                                                    I am not partial to
                                                    garnishing Velouté Sauce
                                                    with carrots, an onion with
                                                    a clove stuck into it, and a
                                                    faggot, as many do. The
                                                    stock should be sufficiently
                                                    fragrant of itself.

                                                <li>
                                                    The only exception I should
                                                    make would be for mushroom
                                                    parings... the latter may
                                                    not, however, be added to
                                                    the stock itself, as they
                                                    would blacken it; hence I
                                                    advise their addition to the
                                                    Velouté during its
                                                    preparation.

                                            This is identical with ordinary
                                            Velouté, except that instead of
                                            having white veal stock for its
                                            liquor, it is diluted with white
                                            poultry stock. The mode of procedure
                                            and the time allowed for cooking are
                                            the same.

                                            Velouté is the base of various fish
                                            sauces whose recipes will be given
                                            in Part II. Prepare it in precisely
                                            the same way as poultry velouté, but
                                            instead of using poultry stock, use
                                            very clear fish fumet, and let it
                                            despumate for twenty minutes only.
                                            (See fish fumet No. 11.)

                                            Allemande Sauce is not, strictly
                                            speaking, a basic sauce. However, it
                                            is so often resorted to in the
                                            preparation of other sauces that I
                                            think it necessary to give it after
                                            the Veloutés, from which it is
                                            derived.

Cooking stock only includes the leading sauces, but I shall refer to the small hot sauces and the cold sauces at the end of the auxiliary stock.",\n        "Experience, which plays such an important part in culinary work, is nowhere so necessary as in the preparation of sauces, for not only must the latter flatter the palate, but they must also vary in savour, consistence and viscosity, in accordance with the dishes they accompany. By this means, in a well-ordered dinner, each dish differs from the preceding ones and from those that follow.",\n        "Furthermore, sauces must, through the perfection of their preparation, obey the general laws of a rational hygiene, wherefore they should be served and combined in such wise as to allow of easy digestion by the frequently disordered stomachs of their consumers.",\n        "Carême was quite justified in pluming himself upon the fact that during his stay at the English Court his master—the Prince Regent—had assured him that he (Carême) was the only one among those who had served his Highness whose cooking had been at all easy of digestion. Carême had grasped the essential truth that the richer the cooking is, the more speedily do the stomach and palate tire of it. And, indeed, it is a great mistake to suppose that, in order to do good cooking, it is necessary to be prodigal in one’s use of all things. In reality, practice dictates fixed and regular quantities, and from these one cannot diverge without upsetting the hygienic and sapid equilibrium on which the value of a sauce depends. The requisite quantities of each ingredient must, of course, be used, but neither more nor less, as there are objections to either extreme.",\n        "Any sauce whatsoever should be smooth, light (without being liquid), glossy to the eye, and decided in taste.

Cooking stock only includes the leading sauces, but I shall refer to the small hot sauces and the cold sauces at the end of the auxiliary stock.","Experience, which plays such an important part in culinary work, is nowhere so necessary as in the preparation of sauces, for not only must the latter flatter the palate, but they must also vary in savour, consistence and viscosity, in accordance with the dishes they accompany. By this means, in a well-ordered dinner, each dish differs from the preceding ones and from those that follow.","Furthermore, sauces must, through the perfection of their preparation, obey the general laws of a rational hygiene, wherefore they should be served and combined in such wise as to allow of easy digestion by the frequently disordered stomachs of their consumers.","Carême was quite justified in pluming himself upon the fact that during his stay at the English Court his master—the Prince Regent—had assured him that he (Carême) was the only one among those who had served his Highness whose cooking had been at all easy of digestion. Carême had grasped the essential truth that the richer the cooking is, the more speedily do the stomach and palate tire of it. And, indeed, it is a great mistake to suppose that, in order to do good cooking, it is necessary to be prodigal in one’s use of all things. In reality, practice dictates fixed and regular quantities, and from these one cannot diverge without upsetting the hygienic and sapid equilibrium on which the value of a sauce depends. The requisite quantities of each ingredient must, of course, be used, but neither more nor less, as there are objections to either extreme.","Any sauce whatsoever should be smooth, light (without being liquid), glossy to the eye, and decided in taste. When these conditions are fulfilled it is always easy to digest even for tired stomachs.","An essential point in the making of sauces is the seasoning, and it would be impossible for me to lay sufficient stress on the importance of not indulging in any excess in this respect. It too often happens that the insipidness of a badly-made sauce is corrected by excessive seasoning; this is an absolutely deplorable practice.","Seasoning should be so calculated as to be merely a complementary factor, which, though it must throw the savour of dishes into relief, may not form a recognisable part of them. If it be excessive, it modifies and even destroys the taste peculiar to every dish—to the great detriment of the latter and of the consumer’s health.","It is therefore desirable that each sauce should possess its own special flavour, well defined, the result of the combined flavours of all its ingredients.","If, in the making of sauces, one allowed oneself to be guided by those principles which are the very foundation of good cookery, the general denunciation of sauces by the medical faculty would be averted; and this denunciation no sauce deserves if it be carefully prepared, conformably with the laws prescribed by practice and its resulting experience."],"sections":[{"title":"The Roux","introduction":["The roux being the cohering element of leading sauces, it is necessary to reveal its preparation and constituents before giving one’s attention to the latter.","Three kinds of roux are used—namely, brown roux, for brown sauces; pale roux, for veloutés, or cream sauces; and white roux, for white sauces and Béchamel."],"entries":[{"number":19,"title":"BROWN ROUX","type":"recipe","yield":"Quantities for making about One lb.","ingredients":"$Y","instructions":"$Y","notes":"$Y"},"$Y","$Y"]},"$Y"]}}}\n',
