#### 19 — BROWN ROUX

This is your brown sauce anchor. Cook slow and even until you smell toasted hazelnut — not bonfire. Rush it and you’ll torch the starch, then you’ll need triple the roux and still end up with a bitter, muddy mess. Don’t be that muppet.

**Ingredients**

- 8 oz (227 g) clarified butter
- 9 oz (255 g) best-quality flour

**Instructions**

1. In a heavy, wide pan on low–medium heat, whisk together the clarified butter and flour until smooth. Keep the heat moderate — you’re coaxing, not scorching.
2. Stir constantly with a flat-edged spatula, sweeping the corners like your job depends on it — because it bloody does. Cook until the mix turns a fine, light brown and smells like toasted hazelnut. If it goes dark or smells burnt, you’ve cocked it — start over.
3. As soon as it hits that light brown, pull it off the heat. Use warm to hot liquids later; cold liquid into hot roux is how you make lumps that look like a donkey chewed them.

> - Cook too hot and you shrivel starch cells before they swell, destroying the binding power. Then your sauce won’t clear and it’ll taste bitter. Control the heat, you clown.
