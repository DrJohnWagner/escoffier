    "introduction": [
        "Listen up, you donkeys. Warm sauces come in two bloody camps: the big dogs — the “mother sauces” — and the little hangers-on that borrow their spine from the mothers. We’re focusing on the leaders, the proper foundations. The rest can queue up behind and mind their manners, because if you can’t nail these, you’ve no business near a stove.",
        "Sauces aren’t just wet hats for food — they’re the swagger, the shine, the finish. They must flatter the palate, match the dish, and hit the plate with the right body — not sludge, not soup. In a well-run service, every course lands different to the last. If your sauces all taste the same, congratulations: you’ve cooked a parade of mediocrity. Fix it.",
        "And for the love of all that’s holy, make them digestible. Rich doesn’t mean reckless. Cook clever, not stupid. Use what you need — no more, no less. You start free-pouring like a muppet and you’ll upset the balance and churn stomachs faster than last night’s staff meal.",
        "Carême wasn’t faffing about when he kept things precise. He understood a simple truth: excess is lazy. Precision is power. These sauces demand discipline — exact quantities, exact technique — or they’ll spit in your face and separate right on the pass. You’ll cry, and I’ll say: “It’s fucking raw!” even when it’s not, because you didn’t listen.",
        "A proper sauce is smooth, glossy, and confident. It clings without clagging; it’s light without being thin. Get the seasoning right — never a sledgehammer, always a spotlight. If I can taste the seasoning as a thing, you’ve overdone it, you plonker.",
        "Each sauce should have its own voice — distinct, unmistakable — the combined character of its ingredients. Respect that or you’ll serve beige sadness. Do it right, and even a knackered guest will mop the plate clean with a grin. Do it wrong, and the health inspector will be the least of your problems.",
        "Now stand up straight, wipe your station, and learn. We build from roux — the glue — and climb to Espagnole, Velouté, Béchamel, Tomato, Hollandaise, and the rest. Nail these, and your kitchen stops being a clown car and starts cooking like it gives a damn."
